<body><h1>Music</h1>
<p>Music is something that has been an integral part of my life as long as I can remember. My mom taught Jazzercise for 20 years,  so I would hear the same songs played over and over again as my mom was learning new routines to teach in her classes. She was also wildly obsessed with Aerosmith, and even met the band multiple times (pictured below). </p>

<p>My dad loved 90's country and we listened to it a lot when I was a kid. I even had an Alan Jackson poster on my closet door. My brother plays just about every instrument there is.  I even ended up  married to a musician for 10 years. As you can tell, music has never been far from my surroundings. Some of my current favorites are Jimmy Eat World, Durand Jones &amp; The Indications, Nuovo Testamento, and Mannequin Pussy. I've added a playlist below for you to listen to some of my favorite songs!</p>
