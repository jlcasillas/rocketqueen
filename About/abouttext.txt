Hello! My name is Jennifer Casillas. I've been in Albuquerque for 2 years, and before that was in Austin for 15 years. I am working on getting my Bachelors in Liberal Arts. I started college back in the mid 2000's, but never finished. So I decided to take advantage of the Opportunity Scholarship and finally finish my degree at 40 years old. I am an Administrative Coordinator at the College of Pharmacy here at UNM, and I really enjoy working here. I am not majoring in anything specific, as I really love what I do in the administrative world. My hope is to take courses that I find interesting to gain more knowledge and add to my skillset. I know having a degree will give me more opportunities for growth here at UNM, as well as a sense of accomplishment knowing I finally completed something I started 20 years ago. 

In my free time, I like to go on hikes with my dog, Dina. I like watching movies, checking out thrift stores, and finding new things to do around Albuquerque. I also really love styling outfits. There aren't many colors or patterns I shy away from. The freedom of expression and creativity I get from styling fun outfits is something I'm really passionate about. I have an 18 year old orange cat named Cosby. I've had him since he was a little kitten. He's old and a little grumpy, but still loves to cuddle and spend time with his Mama. So we definitely squeeze in some lazy days together too.
